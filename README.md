# ExpensesApp
An Expense App I created in React.

This is a small React App created for my Final Project of my Web Programming Class. It utilizes React and MongoDB as a cloud storage.

Instructions to Run:
1. Run in terminal: npm install
2. Run in terminal: npm run dev
3. Server should begin and App should start up.

Instructions to Use:
1. Incomes can be created or viewed using the Tabs in the Header area.
2. After an income is created, a synopsis of a monthly income is given, and bills are listed thereforth.
3. Bills can be added using the now changed header Tabs.
4. Different Incomes can be viewed by using the View/Delete option when the current view has been closed.
5. All data is saved on MongoDB so it can be returned to at any point.
